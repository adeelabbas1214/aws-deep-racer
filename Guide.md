## Introduction

This guide helps you set up an AWS DeepRacer model, write a custom reward function, and train the model for optimal performance. Follow these steps to improve the car's speed and ability to stay on track.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account with access to AWS DeepRacer.
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with AWS services like S3 and CloudWatch.

---

## Step 1: Create and Configure AWS DeepRacer Model

1. **Sign in to AWS Console:**
   - Go to the [AWS DeepRacer Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer).
   
2. **Create a New Model:**
   - Click **Create Model**.
   - Name your model and select a **track** (e.g., American Hills Speedway).
   
3. **Set Hyperparameters:**
   - Leave default values for **batch size**, **learning rate**, and **exploration** to start. You can tune them later.
   
4. **Select Action Space:**
   - Choose a **discrete action space** to start, with predefined speeds and steering angles.

---

## Step 2: Write a Custom Reward Function

1. **Go to the Reward Function Section:**
   - In the model creation flow, you'll find a section to input your custom reward function.
   
2. **Add the Following Reward Function:**

```python
def reward_function(params):
    # Unpacking the parameters
    speed = params['speed']
    distance_from_center = params['distance_from_center']
    track_width = params['track_width']
    heading = params['heading']
    steering_angle = abs(params['steering_angle'])

    # Initialize the reward with a base value
    reward = 1.0

    # Check if the car is within the track limits
    if distance_from_center > track_width / 2:
        return 1e-3  # return a very low reward if the car is off track

    # Reward for staying close to the centerline
    marker = 0.1 * track_width  # Adjust this value as needed
    if distance_from_center <= marker:
        reward += 10.0  # Closer to centerline
    else:
        reward += (1 - (distance_from_center / (track_width / 2)))  # Penalize as it goes off track

    # Reward based on speed
    reward += speed * 2.0  # Tune this multiplier for speed emphasis

    # Penalize for sharp steering angles
    if steering_angle > 15:
        reward *= 0.5  # Penalty for sharp turns

    # Bonus for smooth heading changes (encouraging stability)
    if heading >= 0 and heading <= 180:
        reward += 2.0  # Bonus for heading in the preferred direction

    return float(reward)
```

3. **Explanation of the Reward Function:**
   - **Base Reward**: Starts with a reward of `1.0`.
   - **Off-Track Penalty**: Returns `1e-3` if the car goes off-track.
   - **Centerline Reward**: Gives extra points for staying close to the centerline.
   - **Speed Reward**: Encourages higher speeds.
   - **Steering Penalty**: Penalizes sharp turns (steering angle > 15 degrees).
   - **Heading Bonus**: Rewards cars that head in the correct direction (0 to 180 degrees).

---

## Step 3: Train the Model

1. **Select Training Environment:**
   - Choose the same track you selected when creating the model (e.g., American Hills Speedway).
   
2. **Set Training Time:**
   - Start with a training duration of **1-2 hours** to allow the car to learn basic navigation patterns.

3. **Start Training:**
   - Click **Start Training** to begin.
   
4. **Monitor Training:**
   - Use the **AWS DeepRacer Console** to monitor progress, track metrics, and visualize the carâ€™s performance.

---

## Step 4: Evaluate the Model

1. **After Training Completes:**
   - Once the training completes, evaluate the model to check how it performs on the track.
   
2. **Run Evaluation:**
   - In the **Evaluation** section, run your trained model on the same track.
   
3. **Analyze Metrics:**
   - Check metrics like **lap time**, **number of resets**, and **speed consistency**.
   
4. **Identify Areas of Improvement:**
   - Note if the car is getting stuck, going off-track, or moving too slowly.

---

## Step 5: Tune the Model

1. **Adjust the Reward Function:**
   - Based on evaluation metrics, tweak the reward function to improve performance.
   - For example, increase the reward for higher speed or reduce penalties for sharp turns on a curvy track.
   
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Consider adjusting hyperparameters like **learning rate** or **exploration** if the car's learning rate is too slow or too erratic.

3. **Retrain the Model:**
   - After modifying the reward function or hyperparameters, retrain the model for better results.

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up, train, and optimize your AWS DeepRacer model. Use the reward function effectively to balance between speed and control, and continuously refine the model based on evaluation feedback.
